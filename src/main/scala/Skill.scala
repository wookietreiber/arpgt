/** Base class of skills. Depending on how open the RPG system is you want to implement, you should
  * decide whether you want to implement all skills as a sealed class hierarchy with case objects or
  * just a few case classes which can be dynamically set up on a need to have basis.
  *
  * Usually skills, like athletics, are associated with certain attributes, e.g. athletics may
  * depend on stamina, strength and agility. These `defaultAttributes` are used when a skill is
  * checked. But sometimes, especially when it comes to estimating the outcome of an action,
  * checking a skill needs other attributes, like logic or intuition, so associated attributes
  * should neither be fix nor should they have no default.
  *
  * Skills should never hold their actual value, because they are usually saved in a skill-value
  * map.
  *
  * @tparam A used attribute type
  *
  * @see [[rpg.Skills]] for how skills are usually saved
  * @see [[rpg.Attribute]] for the attribute definition
